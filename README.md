#### VIM setup

I have used other IDEs in the past and none have ever stacked up against a well organied vim setup. Text
editors like atom, notepad++, sublime text, and others alike are great editors but they use definitely use
more resources than vim, not only that but once you learn all the hotkeys and obtain master level competence with
vim modes the sky is the limit with what you can do. Vim plugins are also great resources for creating an ultimate
programming enviornment.
